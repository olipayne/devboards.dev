This MCU is the same one used in the Arduino Leonardo, which means the Beetle is compatible with most Arduino IDE-based projects. This compatibility extends to various Arduino shields, making it easy to expand the Beetle's capabilities.\n\nOne of the standout features of the Beetle is its size. It's incredibly small, about the size of a thumb, making it one of the most compact boards in the Arduino-compatible lineup. Despite its size, it doesn't skimp on functionality. It comes equipped with 10 digital I/O pins, 4 PWM channels, and 5 analog inputs. This broad range of inputs and outputs allows it to handle a variety of tasks, from simple LED control to more complex sensor networks.\n\nThe board also includes a built-in USB interface, which serves two purposes: it can be used for programming the board as well as powering it. This dual functionality makes the Beetle convenient for on-the-go development, as you don't need to carry around a separate power supply or programmer.\n\nIn summary, the DFRobot Beetle Board is a tiny yet powerful tool for hobbyists and professionals alike. Its compatibility with Arduino, range of I/O options, and compact size make it a versatile choice for a wide array of electronic projects.",

                "product_desc": "The W5500-EVB-Pico is a microcontroller evaluation board that merges the features of the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller with the W5500 fully hardwired TCP/IP controller. This integration offers the standard functionalities of a Raspberry Pi Pico board, with the added advantage of Ethernet capabilities through the W5500 component. The board is compatible with IoT platforms such as AWS IoT Core and is Microsoft Azure Device Certified.\n\nKey specifications of the W5500-EVB-Pico include:\n\n1.  It is equipped with an RP2040 microcontroller featuring 2MByte Flash, a dual-core Cortex M0+ that can run up to 133MHz, and 264kByte multi-bank high-performance SRAM. The RP2040 also supports external Quad-SPI Flash with execute-in-place (XIP) capability and has a high-performance full-crossbar bus fabric.\n\n2. The board boasts 30 multi-function General Purpose IO pins, of which 4 can be used for ADC, with an IO voltage ranging from 1.8-3.3V. It includes a 12-bit 500ksps Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC) and various digital peripherals such as 2 UARTs, 2 I2C, 2 SPI, 16 PWM channels, a timer with 4 alarms, and a Real-Time Counter. There are also 2 Programmable IO (PIO) blocks totaling 8 state machines, offering flexible, user-programmable high-speed IO that can emulate interfaces like SD Card and VGA.\n\n3. The W5500 module embedded in the board supports hardwired Internet protocols such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, IPv4, ARP, IGMP, PPPoE. It can handle 8 independent hardware sockets simultaneously and includes an internal 32 Kbytes memory for TX/RX buffers. The W5500 supports high-speed Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI MODE 0, 3).\n\n4. The board includes a Micro-USB B port for power, data transfer, and reprogramming the Flash. It has a 40-pin 21x51 'DIP' style 1mm thick PCB with 0.1\" through-hole pins along with edge castellations. A 3-pin ARM Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port is also present.\n- **Networking Capabilities**: It features a 10 / 100 Ethernet PHY, supports auto-negotiation (full/half duplex, 10/100 based), and includes a built-in RJ45 connector.\n\n5. The pinout of the W5500-EVB-Pico is directly connected to the GPIO of the RP2040, mirroring the Raspberry Pi Pico board.
